# TurtleBot3 ROS-based Maze Navigation
This repository includes a ROS package for TurtleBot3 maze navigation project

## Project Requirements 
Autonomous navigation through lanes built of red tapes and walls, with the objective of reaching picking and placing locations from the robotâ€™s home position by avoiding obstacles and manipulating objects, and finally returning back of the robot to its home.

## Package Description
This package deploys the navigation package for SLAM and autonomous navigation with obstacle avoidance. 
It deploys viapoint approach for lane following without crossing the red tapes.
MoveIt package was used for manipulator joint angles control and gripper control, for a pick and place task.
